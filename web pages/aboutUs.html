                    <p>At Kleos self-sustainable farm, we use a wide range of traditional skills to support life, focusing
                        on producing over consuming. Some of the principles we apply are consistent with those of
                        permaculture, that is, a self-sustainable farm makes use of everything on the homestead to create a
                        symbiotic relationship where nothing goes to waste. To this extend, Kleos produces a variety of
                        organic products of the highest quality & nutritional value for its residents as well as members of
                        the local community and beyond.</p>
